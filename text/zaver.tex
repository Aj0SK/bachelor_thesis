The goal of this work was to build the reliable index that will satisfy the needs
of the selective sequencing. We wanted to build this index on top of the discretizing
algorithm that would help us to work with the raw squiggles more easily and also
very fast.

In the Second Chapter we come up with a discretizing algorithm that have been able
to build representation that reliably matches the underlying raw squiggle. We proved
many good properties of this representation in the Results section.

We have been unable to build the reliable yet fast enough index but we obtained
some hints on how the problems that arised could be tackled in the future.
Most notably, we have been able to tweak Minimap2 algorithm and use it to align our discretized form of the
signal to the correct position in the reference. This leads us to the conclusion that
it is possible to use this discretizing algorithm for furher progress in this area.
