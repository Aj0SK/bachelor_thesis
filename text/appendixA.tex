\section{Experiment data}

Our data comes from two organisms, one is Saprochaete ingens and the other one is
Saprochaete fungicola. Both of these organisms are yeasts.

We choose these organisms as they are sequenced by bioinformatics department of
FMFI so we have all the data from the sequencing easily available.
We have available the reference sequences of both these organisms as well as the
raw signals. We base called these reads using the Albacore basecaller develobed by
ONT, company that develop the MinION sequencer.

To see the similarities of these two organisms, we tried to align the reads from
Saprochaete fungicola to the reference sequence of Saprochaete ingens and found
that...
